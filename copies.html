        <h3>Email 2: What Makes Our Soap Different? (Sent 2 Days Later)</h3>
        <p><strong>Subject:</strong> What’s in your soap? (Ours is different.)</p>
        <p><strong>Preview Text:</strong> Not all soaps are created equal. Here’s why ours stands out.</p>
        <p><strong>Header:</strong> The Secret to Healthier, Hydrated Skin ✨</p>
        <p><strong>Body:</strong></p>
        <p>Many mass-produced soaps strip away glycerin, leaving your skin dry. Ours retains every drop, so your skin stays soft, moisturized, and never stripped.</p>
        <p>🌱 What’s Inside?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>✔️ Glycerin-Rich Hydration – Seals in moisture naturally.</li>
            <li>✔️ Fresh Goat’s Milk – Soothes sensitive skin & reduces irritation.</li>
            <li>✔️ Shea Butter & Organic Oils – Deeply nourish & restore skin elasticity.</li>
            <li>✔️ No Palm Oil. No Harsh Chemicals. No Compromises.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your skin deserves more than just a soap. It deserves a ritual.</p>
